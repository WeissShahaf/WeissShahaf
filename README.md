## Hi, I'm Shahaf Weiss

**Neuroscience Consultant & Electrophysiology Specialist**

PhD in Neuroscience with 15+ years of hands-on experience analyzing neural data across species — from rodents to primates. I help research labs solve their hardest electrophysiology problems: designing analysis pipelines, debugging broken workflows, and training teams to be self-sufficient.

Founder of **Rent-A-Spike** consulting.

### What I Do

**Consulting** — Designing experiments, analysis workflows, behavioral arenas, silicon probes, and 3D-printed drives. Troubleshooting pipelines that aren't working.

**Scientific Programming** — Building custom Python and MATLAB pipelines for spike sorting, signal processing, pose estimation, and neural-behavioral integration.

**Teaching** — Hands-on workshops for research teams covering spike sorting, denoising, debugging, and comparative neuroanatomy.
